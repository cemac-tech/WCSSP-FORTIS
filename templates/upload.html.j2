  <p><b>Browse to select a file to upload</b></p>
  <p>
    <b>Note: </b>
    You can only upload one file at a time.
    If you would like to upload a number of files with the same title, description, etc,
    (e.g. a collection of related image files for a given practical), you can zip up the
    files first and upload the zip file. If zipping up the files on a Linux/Unix machine,
    it is best to use 'zip' rather than e.g. 'tar' to ensure that the trainees can unzip
    the file on Windows machines. To do this, type at the command line:
    <span style="font-family:Courier;">$ zip my_chosen_name.zip file1 file2 file3 etc</span>,
    or to zip a directory, type:
    <span style="font-family:Courier;">$ zip -r my_chosen_name.zip dir1</span>.
    To extract a zip file on Linux, type:
    <span style="font-family:Courier;">$ unzip zip_file_name.zip</span>.
    If zipping up the files on a Windows machine, right-click in a blank area on your desktop
    or in explorer, go to 'New', and select "Compressed (zipped) Folder", rename the zip folder
    as desired, and select and drag your files into the zip folder.
    To extract a zip file on Windows, right-click on the zip file and select "Extract All..."
    followed by "Extract".
